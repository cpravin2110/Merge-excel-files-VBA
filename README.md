# Merge-excel-files-VBA

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to automate the merging of multiple Excel sales data files into a single sheet using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications).

Instead of manually copying and pasting data, this VBA macro:

Prompts the user to select a folder containing multiple Excel files.

Reads each file and extracts the data.

Copies the header only once (from the first file).

Appends all data into a new sheet in the current workbook.

This automation helps save time and reduce errors in handling large sets of sales data.
